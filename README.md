# microbit-timerbit
I don't know what code I wrote.

Because this project was pretty big for me, I gave up on block coding, I gave up on thinking and wrote code.
## How to use
Timers are set in the order of hours, minutes, and seconds.

Subtract the value with button A and add the value with button B.

Switch the time, minutes, and seconds with the A+B button, and set the seconds, and this button becomes the timer start button.

The logo button is an escape button. In all situations, return the timer to its initial state.
